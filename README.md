# Third Person Shooter
An experimental third person shooter written with JavaScript and canvas.

Based off of [Jason Brown](https://codepen.io/loktar00/)'s Pen [Part 1 platformer tutorial](https://codepen.io/loktar00/pen/jHwBL).

## Goals
- Offer basic combat inspired by [AssaultCube](http://assault.cubers.net), but with a 2D TPS instead of a 3D FPS.
- Follow the [component pattern](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html) to keep the game maintainable.
- Avoid using game libraries unless they are simple and open source.
